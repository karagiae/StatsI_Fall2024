	\section*{Question 1: Political Science}
		\vspace{.25cm}
	The following table was created using the data from a study run in a major Latin American city.\footnote{Fried, Lagunes, and Venkataramani (2010). ``Corruption and Inequality at the Crossroad: A Multimethod Study of Bribery and Discrimination in Latin America. \textit{Latin American Research Review}. 45 (1): 76-97.} As part of the experimental treatment in the study, one employee of the research team was chosen to make illegal left turns across traffic to draw the attention of the police officers on shift. Two employee drivers were upper class, two were lower class drivers, and the identity of the driver was randomly assigned per encounter. The researchers were interested in whether officers were more or less likely to solicit a bribe from drivers depending on their class (officers use phrases like, ``We can solve this the easy way'' to draw a bribe). The table below shows the resulting data.

\newpage
\begin{table}[h!]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
		& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\
		\\[-1.8ex] 
		\hline \\[-1.8ex]
		Upper class & 14 & 6 & 7 \\
		Lower class & 7 & 7 & 1 \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{enumerate}
	
	\item [(a)]
	Calculate the $\chi^2$ test statistic by hand/manually (even better if you can do "by hand" in \texttt{R}).\\
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=32, lastline=73]{PS02_EK.R}  
	
	The $\chi^2$ is 3.791168. 
	
	\item [(b)]
	Now calculate the p-value from the test statistic you just created (in \texttt{R}).\footnote{Remember frequency should be $>$ 5 for all cells, but let's calculate the p-value here anyway.}  What do you conclude if $\alpha = 0.1$?\\
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=77, lastline=80]{PS02_EK.R}
	
	The p-value is 0.1502306 which is smaller than  0.10 (the $\alpha$ level of confidence requested), therefore we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis.  
	
	\newpage
	\item [(c)] Calculate the standardized residuals for each cell and put them in the table below.
	\vspace{1cm}
	
	\begin{table}[h]
		\centering
		\begin{tabular}{l | c c c }
			& Not Stopped & Bribe requested & Stopped/given warning \\
			\\[-1.8ex] 
			\hline \\[-1.8ex]
			Upper class  & 0.1360828  & -0.8153742 & 0.818923 \\
			\\
			Lower class & -0.1825742  &  1.0939393  &   -1.098701\\
			
		\end{tabular}
	\end{table}
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=90, lastline=91]{PS02_EK.R}
	
	\item [(d)] How might the standardized residuals help you interpret the results?  

	The standardized residuals  measure  the strength of the difference between observed and expected values in our table. We can see how much each value of the original table contributes to the $\chi^2$ value. The closer the value to 0, the less the difference between the expected and the observed value. Since the standardized residuals are not larger than +/-2 or +/-3, no extreme values are present in the table. Therefore, there is no strong evidence of a relationship between class (upper, lower) and the likelihood of being stopped, being requested a bribe, or given a warning.
	
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Question 2: Economics}
Chattopadhyay and Duflo were interested in whether women promote different policies than men.\footnote{Chattopadhyay and Duflo. (2004). ``Women as Policy Makers: Evidence from a Randomized Policy Experiment in India. \textit{Econometrica}. 72 (5), 1409-1443.} Answering this question with observational data is pretty difficult due to potential confounding problems (e.g. the districts that choose female politicians are likely to systematically differ in other aspects too). Hence, they exploit a randomized policy experiment in India, where since the mid-1990s, $\frac{1}{3}$ of village council heads have been randomly reserved for women. A subset of the data from West Bengal can be found at the following link: \url{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kosukeimai/qss/master/PREDICTION/women.csv}\\

\noindent Each observation in the data set represents a village and there are two villages associated with one GP (i.e. a level of government is called "GP"). Figure~\ref{fig:women_desc} below shows the names and descriptions of the variables in the dataset. The authors hypothesize that female politicians are more likely to support policies female voters want. Researchers found that more women complain about the quality of drinking water than men. You need to estimate the effect of the reservation policy on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities in the villages.

\end{figure}		

\newpage
\begin{enumerate}
	\item [(a)] State a null and alternative (two-tailed) hypothesis. \\
	 H0 (null hypothesis):  The reservation policy had no effect on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities. \\
	 Ha (alternative hypothesis): The researvation policy had an effect on the number of new or repaired drinking water facilities.
	
	\item [(b)] Run a bivariate regression to test this hypothesis in \texttt{R} (include your code!).
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=R, firstline=109, lastline=110]{PS02_EK.R}
	
	\item [(c)] Interpret the coefficient estimate for reservation policy. 
    \input{regression_output.tex}
    
    The reservation policy led, on average,  to an increase of approximately 9 new or repaired drinking water facilities in reserved villages compared to non-reserved ones. The result is statistically significant at the 5\% confidence level ($p < 0.05$). Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis and claim that there is a positive impact of the women politicians on the improvement of drinking water facilities.
